# Personality Analysis Animation

A Manim animation explaining the Personality Analysis System architecture and functionality.

## Animation Overview

This animation demonstrates the key concepts of the personality analysis system:

### 1. System Architecture
- Shows the main components: Traits DB, Persons DB, Companies, and Matching Engine
- Illustrates how data flows between components

### 2. Data Processing Flow
- Demonstrates how person descriptions are converted to personality traits
- Shows the analysis process from text input to numerical personality scores

### 3. Personality Matching Process
- Explains how job descriptions are analyzed for target personalities
- Shows Euclidean distance calculation for candidate ranking
- Demonstrates the final ranked results

### 4. Technical Implementation
- CLI command examples
- Database structure visualization
- Results output format

## Features Explained

- **Trait-based Analysis**: How personality traits (friendliness/dominance) are extracted from text
- **Dynamic Personality Updates**: How profiles evolve as new traits are added
- **Euclidean Distance Matching**: The mathematical approach to finding personality compatibility
- **Service Architecture**: Clean separation between DAOs, Services, and CLI commands

## Running the Animation

```bash
manim -pql manim-animation.py PersonalityAnalysisAnimation
```

## Output

The animation generates a video file at:
`media/videos/manim-animation/480p15/PersonalityAnalysisAnimation.mp4`

## Educational Value

This animation is designed to help understand:
- How personality analysis systems work
- The mathematics behind trait matching
- System architecture patterns
- Data flow in analytical applications
